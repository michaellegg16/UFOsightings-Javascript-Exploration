# **UFOsightings-Javascript-Exploration

### Task 

* Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects (data.js), write code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.
    * Include columns for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment.

* Write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.

### Instructions

1. Run the index.html file with a local live server for testing purposes.
1. If you just want to visit the site, you can visit it at:
1. To filter the data by date, simply input the desired date in the box on the left and click on the button.

### Conclusion

Since this data is artificial and for testing purposes, not much can be concluded from the information. It only covers a short time frame and does has a small number of data points. The main purpose of this exercise was to explore basic JavaScript functions and create filtering elements. Appending the data into a table was fairly simple especially since the data was already in the form of a JavaScript array. Creating the filtering elements was a bit more difficult but not terribly daunting. This exercise primarily taught me how to implement basic logic into JavaScript and how to display JavaScript elements with HTML.
